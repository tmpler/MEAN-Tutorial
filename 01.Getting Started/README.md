# Linux Server
To get started I'm going to be using an Ubuntu Virtual Machine. I'm running Windows 10 and will be using putty to access the command line of the server. I'll also be using the code editor Atom. I use Atom as I like the syntax highlighting and the plugins available.

## Setting up your Linux Server
Options:
A. You are already running a machine with a unix-like console and you are comfortable troubleshooting your OS.
B. You are running Windows and you have good enough hardware to run a virtual machine.
C. You are running Windows and you need to use a remote server.

### A. I'm all Set
Fantastic. Move on

### B. Using Windows and a Local VM
TODO: Make Guide More Detailed
Install Oracle VirtualBox if you haven't already.
Download Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Server (Use another distro if you are comfortable troubleshooting it).
Set up new Linux Machine on VirtualBox, insert Virtual Disk and start box.
Install Ubuntu Server Following installation prompt.
Setup SSH for SFTP to put code on server over secure connection.

### C. Using Windows and Remote VM
TODO: Make Guide More Detailed
Setting Up a remote server. Use AWS for a free server with minimum specifications or use [digital ocean and get $10 free credit with my referral link](https://m.do.co/c/fbefaeb56055)
If using Digital Ocean, great an Ubuntu 16.04 Droplet and follow the initial Ubuntu Setup Guide. When you have finished you will have SSH access and Putty.
